<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains a collection of KiCAD mechanical keyboard templates using a variety of MCU's. Within each templates are schematics that lay out the basic connection between essential components as well as sub-sheets where the designer can implement their own key matrix and, in some cases, RGB LED underglow implementations. In most cases the KiCAD libraries in use were provided by [ai03](https://github.com/ai03-2725)

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
## Requirements

- [KiCAD v5](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/)

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/CaninoDev/Mechanica_Keyboard_KiCAD_Templates $TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY` where `$TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY` is the path to templates by your version of KiCAD. You can view and set the path by starting up KiCAD and going to `Preferences --> Configure Path --> KICAD_USER_TEMPLATE_DIR`
- Once installed, go to `File --> Start a New Project From Template` and select the desired template from the list.

### Design Guidelines

<!-- PCB DESIGN -->
#### PCB Design

- Keep traces from the connector to the MCU as short as possible.
- Generally, avoid the use of sharp bends when laying down track.
- Power and Ground traces should be wide.
- Place the crystal as close to the MCU as possible.
- Isolate the oscillator as much as possible:
  - Separate the ground plane underneath the crystal generally.
- D+ and D- traces should match up in distance as close as possible (so the signals are in sync). Use differential(90Œ©) traces.
- Fill Zones: It is not necessary to fill the entire PCB with ground/power plane. It is sufficient to encompass the crystal, USB and MCU footprints in a ground fill.

### Reference Keyboards

Please note, some of the following keyboards have schematics that may be incomplete. I try to make note of those keyboards but cannot guarantee that I have caught them all.

<!-- DISCLAIMER -->
## Disclaimer

As I am still learning how to design keyboards, there may be some implementations that does not represent best practices or may even be incorrect. In such cases, please make a pull request and I will incorporate the corrections promptly. When creating a new design from template, KiCAD copies over the local libraries but doesn't preserve their respective git. This results in a relatively larger project with the inability to effortlessly update local libraries.
